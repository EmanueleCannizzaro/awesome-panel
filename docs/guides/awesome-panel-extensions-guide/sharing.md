## Distributing Your Extension on PyPi

Sharing one or more extensions as a package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) requires packaging your Python project as you would do for any other Python project.

The [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) guide describes this.

You can also study the [Awesome Panel Extensions Repository](https://github.com/marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel-extensions) to see how a specific Panel Extensions Package is set up. You can find the `awesome-panel-extensions` package on PyPi [here](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-panel-extensions/).

## Contributing Your Extension to Panel

It's as easy as suggesting it as a Feature Request or providing it as a Pull request on the [Panel Github site](https://github.com/holoviz/panel).
