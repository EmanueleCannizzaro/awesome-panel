## Distributing Your Extension on PyPi

Sharing one or more extensions as a package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/) requires packaging your Python project as you would do for any other Python project.

The [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/) guide describes this.

You can also study the [Awesome Panel Extensions Repository](https://github.com/marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel-extensions) to see how a specific Panel Extensions Package is set up. You can find the `awesome-panel-extensions` package on PyPi [here](https://pypi.org/project/awesome-panel-extensions/).

If your extension contains Bokeh extensions, you have to make sure your bokeh `bokeh.ext.json` and your build `dist`files are shipped with your package.

- In [setup.py](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel-extensions/blob/master/setup.py) you need to set `include_package_data=True` to enable the use of a `Manifest.in` file.
- Your [Manifest.in](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel-extensions/blob/master/Manifest.in) file then needs to include something like

```bash
include awesome_panel_extensions/*.json
include awesome_panel_extensions/index.ts
include awesome_panel_extensions/bokeh_extensions/*.ts
graft awesome_panel_extensions/dist
```
