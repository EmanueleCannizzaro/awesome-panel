## Getting Started with the Awesome Panel Repository

### Prerequisites

- A working [Python](https://www.python.org/) installation.
    - You need Python >= 3.9.

### Installation

Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen/awesome-panel.git
```

cd into the project root folder

```bash
cd awesome-panel
```

#### Create virtual environment and install Requirements

##### via python

Then you should create a virtual environment named .venv

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

and activate the environment using one of the below commands.

```bash
source .venv/Scripts/activate
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

or for windows

```bash
.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```

On windows please manually install the geopandas requirements as described in [using-geopandas-windows](https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/)

Then you should install the local requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements_local.txt -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

##### or via Anaconda

Create virtual environment named awesome-panel

```bash
conda create -n awesome-panel python=3.9.9
```

and activate environment.

```bash
activate awesome-panel
```

On windows please manually install the geopandas requirements as described in [using-geopandas-windows](https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/)

Then you should install the local requirements

```bash
conda install --file requirements_local.txt
```

### Build and run the Application Locally

#### Set the environment variables if needed

on bash:

```bash
export BOKEH_ADDRESS=localhost
export BOKEH_PORT=5006
```

on powershell:

```powershell
$env:BOKEH_ADDRESS = 'localhost'
$env:BOKEH_PORT = 5006
```

Running the Application Locally

```bash
python app.py
```

or in a jupyter notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook app.ipynb
```

or as a Docker container via

```bash
invoke docker.build --rebuild
invoke docker.run-server
```

### Run the Application using the image on Dockerhub

If you don't want to clone the repo and build the docker container you can just use `docker run` to run the image from [Dockerhub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/marcskovmadsen/repository/docker/marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel)

To run the panel interactively on port 80

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel:latest
```

To run bash interactively

```bash
docker run -it -p 80:80 --entrypoint "/bin/bash" marcskovmadsen/awesome-panel:latest
```

## Build and Deploy the Awesome Panel Package

You can build the package using

```bash
cd package
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

If you want to publish the package to PyPi you should first

update the version number in the setup.py file. The format is `YYYYmmdd.version`. For example `20191208.1`

Then you run

```bash
twine upload dist/awesome-panel-YYYYmmdd.version.tar.gz -u <the-pypi-username> -p <the-pypi-password>
```

### Code quality and Tests

We use

- [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) for sorting import statements
- [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) to remove unused imports and unused variables
- [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) the opinionated code formatter
- [pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) for static analysis
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) for static type checking
- [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) for unit to functional tests

to ensure a high quality of our code and application.

You can run all tests using

```bash
invoke test.all
```

### Workflow

We use the power of [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) to semi-automate the local workflow. You can see the list of available commands using

```bash
$ invoke --list
