[Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/) is a powerful framework for building awesome-analytics apps in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The purpose of this app is to test that a **multi-page Dashboard Layout** similar to the [bootstrap dashboard template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/dashboard/) from [getboostrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) can be implemented in [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/).

Navigate to the **Dashboard Page** via the **Sidebar** to see the result.
Or Navigate to the **Limitations Page** to learn of some of the limitations of Panel that
I've experienced."""
