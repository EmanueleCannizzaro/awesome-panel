"""In this module we test the `Markdown` functionality of `awesome_panel.express`

The `Markdown` functionality of Panel is limited as it does not support

- One liners for using Markdown from files
- Code blocks
- Indented Markdown text as is often what is used in Editors like VS Code.

Please note you need to run `Code.extend()` in order to add the CODE_HILITE CSS to the app.
