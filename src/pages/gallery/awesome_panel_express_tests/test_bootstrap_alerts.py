"""Tests of the Alert panes inspired by Bootstrap Alerts.

Please note that in order to use the bootstrap functionality you need to run
`awesome_panel.express.bootstrap.extend()` to import the relevant css.

Please note the css and javascript of Bootstrap and does not play well with Panel/ Bokeh in my
experience.

- The JavaScript we cannot use as it confuses the Bokeh layout engine
- The CSS has to be rewritten. So that is what I have to done the few things I need.
