# About

The purpose of this app is to test that a **multi-page Dashboard Layout** similar to the [bootstrap dashboard template](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/examples/dashboard/) from [getboostrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/) can be implemented in [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/).

The layout with a header, navigation sidebar and a main area is what powers [awesome-panel.org](https://awesome-panel.org).
